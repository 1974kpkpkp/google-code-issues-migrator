This is a simple script to move issues from google code to github.

Some liberties have been taken (as we cannot, for example, know which google user corresponds to other user on github). But most information is complete.

Requirements
------------
* [Google Data Python Library](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/)
* [github2](http://github.com/ask/python-github2) - Github API v2 library for Python
